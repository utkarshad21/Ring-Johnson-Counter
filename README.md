# Ring-Johnson-Counter
Ring and Johnson Counter is a sequential circuit. Presented counter is of 4-bit where both ring and johnson are combined into a single design. If r/j = 0, then the circuit will work as Ring counter and if r/j = 1, then the circuit will work as Johnson Counter. Reset is asynchronus in nature in the circuit, therefore if reset arrives irrespective of clock then the output will be cleared.
